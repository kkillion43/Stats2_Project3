Logistic Regression Analysis - Osteoporosis within Women over age 55

Introduction 

Between 2005 and 2014, the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW) conducted a study to further an understanding of ways to prevent and minimize the probabilities of fracture related incidences associated with osteoporosis. This disease heavily impacts roughly 200 million people and life expectancies continue to keep growing. It is vital to gather further knowledge and awareness to improve quality of life within the golden years. 

The design of experiment considered a wide variety of diverse observations. Among 10 countries sampled (Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, UK, and USA), Figure 1 shows how the study sample is broken down by Geographic Regions. These patients were sampled through physician practices and were a representative sample of the practice within its region. These physicians possessed a high level of expertise over the field of osteoporosis. The sites were filtered by its ability to supervise assessments and conduct treatment options which would be the data supplied for comparisons with the GLOW sample. By doing this, the available sites became somewhat limited when selecting them for the analysis (2010, University of Massachusetts Medical School). 

Our intentions are to explore this data set with logistic regression techniques to manufacture a model that provides insight over subject characteristics in relation with osteoporosis. Determining odds ratios, probabilities, and accurately discerning which lifestyle factors that are more threatening can further assist the fight against osteoporosis.
